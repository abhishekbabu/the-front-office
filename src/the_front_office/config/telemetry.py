"""OpenTelemetry tracing, exported to Logfire.

Everything worth measuring in this app happens inside a library: the outbound
HTTP to Yahoo, Sleeper, nba_api and FPL, and the Gemini calls. Both have
auto-instrumentation, so tracing is configured here and nowhere else — no span
is opened by hand, and neither `domain/` nor `application/` learns that
telemetry exists. That is the whole reason this stays a config concern rather
than becoming a port.

Inert without a token. `send_to_logfire="if-token-present"` means a fresh clone,
CI and the test suite make no network call and need no secret, while the
instrumentation itself is still installed — so a missing token changes where
spans go, not whether the code runs.
