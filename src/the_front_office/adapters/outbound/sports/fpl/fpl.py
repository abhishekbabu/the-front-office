"""Fantasy Premier League on the official game.

The only sport here whose league platform is also its stats provider: the same
payload that lists a squad carries expected goals, ownership and the game's own
next-gameweek projection, so there is no second platform to join names against.

What binds a decision is money and a transfer allowance rather than a waiver
budget or a set of lineup slots, and the highest-leverage call of the week is
the captaincy — which is why the report leads with it.

There is no trade path. FPL managers do not exchange players with each other;
the equivalent action is a transfer against the market, which the scouting
report already recommends.
