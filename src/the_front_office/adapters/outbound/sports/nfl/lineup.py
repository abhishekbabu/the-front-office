"""Optimal lineup selection.

Deliberately not delegated to the model. "Which legal lineup maximises projected
points" is a constraint-satisfaction problem with an exact answer; asking an LLM
would introduce error into the one part of the football report that has none.
The model's job is judgement — is the projection trustworthy, is the matchup
bad, is the injury real — not arithmetic.
