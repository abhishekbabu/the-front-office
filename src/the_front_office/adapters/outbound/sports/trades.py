"""Resolving the players named in a trade.

How a name becomes a player differs per platform — a Yahoo search, a lookup
against a Sleeper catalog — but the policy around it does not: resolve both
sides, and if anything failed, name every failure at once. A user with a typo on
each side should fix one message, not discover the second on the re-run.
