"""Assembling what a category league needs to know about one player.

Three readings meet here, and they answer different questions: Yahoo says who
holds the player, Sleeper's box scores say what they have been doing, and
Sleeper's projections say what they are expected to do over the games left in
the matchup period. A line without the games remaining is a rate with no
quantity behind it, which is why they are built together.
