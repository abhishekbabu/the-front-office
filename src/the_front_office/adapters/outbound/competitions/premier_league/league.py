Separate from the gameweek because it answers a different question asked at a
different time — how the season is going, rather than what to do before the
deadline — and it costs requests the week does not need.

No activity section: FPL publishes no transfer feed for a mini-league, and a
tab that is always empty is worse than one that is not there.
