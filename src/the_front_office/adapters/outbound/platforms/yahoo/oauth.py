"""The Yahoo OAuth2 authorization-code flow.

Written here rather than delegated because the vendor CLI's flow is subtly
wrong in a way Yahoo no longer tolerates. It authorizes against the real
redirect URI and then exchanges the code with `redirect_uri="oob"`, a value it
never authorized against. RFC 6749 §4.1.3 requires the two to be identical.
Yahoo answers that mismatch with a token rather than an error — one that
authenticates and carries no grant, so every endpoint returns 403 instead of
401, including endpoints that need no permission at all. Nothing downstream can
tell that apart from a permissions problem.

It also requests no `scope`, leaving the grant to be inferred. This asks for
`fspt-r` explicitly, which is what the app is actually going to use.

The token is written in the vendor's own persistence format, so its `Context`
keeps working and only the handshake changes.
