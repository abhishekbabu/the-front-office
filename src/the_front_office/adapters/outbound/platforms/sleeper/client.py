"""Sleeper API client.

Sleeper is public and read-only: no OAuth, no API key. The whole surface is
plain GETs, which is why the football path has nothing resembling the Yahoo
login flow.

Sleeper asks callers to stay under 1000 requests/minute and to fetch the player
catalog "once per day at most". Everything cacheable is cached on disk with a
TTL chosen per endpoint: the catalog daily, projections for a settled week
effectively forever, trending for an hour.
