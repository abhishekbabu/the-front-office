"""Types for the Fantasy Premier League API.

The official game is a public read-only JSON API — no key, no OAuth — and it is
unusual in carrying both layers at once: the same payload that lists your squad
also carries Opta-derived expected goals and assists. Nothing here needs a
second stats provider the way the NBA path does.

Money is in tenths of a million throughout, the unit the API uses: a `now_cost`
of 40 is £4.0m. Converting on the way in would lose the exact arithmetic that
transfer affordability depends on, so it is converted only for display.
