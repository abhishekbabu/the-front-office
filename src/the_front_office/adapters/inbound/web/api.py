"""HTTP API for the web UI.

An inbound adapter like the CLI: it renders errors and owns transport, and
computes nothing. The engines already return Pydantic models, so a route's
response schema is the domain model itself — `ScoutReport` and `TradeVerdict`
cross the wire exactly as the CLI renders them, with no second representation
to keep in step.

Serves the built front end from `web/dist` when it exists, so one process on one
port covers both. In development the front end runs its own dev server and calls
back here across the proxy configured in `web/vite.config.ts`.
