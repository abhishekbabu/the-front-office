"""Recent form and remaining games, read from Sleeper.

Basketball already read its projections from Sleeper; this is the other half —
what a player has actually been doing lately, and how many games their club has
left inside the matchup period. Both used to come from NBA.com, which meant two
independent name joins against Yahoo and a second platform to keep cached.

Form is per game rather than per week on purpose: a category league is won over
a matchup period, and "the last ten games" is a window a weekly bucket of three
or four cannot be cut at.
