"""Rendering a football week as the text a model reads.

Kept away from the provider because it is a different kind of work: everything
here turns state already gathered into prose, and none of it decides anything.
The provider fetches and the prompt describes.

`_matchup` returns both the prose and the header figures because they come from
the same three requests; deriving them separately would fetch the scoreboard
twice for one report.
