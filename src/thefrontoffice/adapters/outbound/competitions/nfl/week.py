"""One football week, gathered once and read by everything that describes it.

The week is the unit this sport is organised around: the lineup view, the
league view and the prompt all ask about the same seven days, and all three
would otherwise fetch the same projections and re-run the same lineup solve.
Gathering it once means they cannot disagree about the totals by a rounding.

`Live` sits beside it because "what has been scored" and "what is projected"
are the same question asked at two different times, and a row has to know
which of the two it is showing.
