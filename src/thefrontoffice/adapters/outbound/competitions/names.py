"""Matching player names across platforms.

Fantasy platforms and stats providers rarely share an identifier, so a player
typed by a user or listed by one service has to be matched to another by name.
The policy is deliberately conservative: a wrong match silently attributes one
player's numbers to another, which is worse than no match at all.
