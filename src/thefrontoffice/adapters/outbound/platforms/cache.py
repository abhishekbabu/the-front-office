"""One JSON cache on disk, shared by every platform this app reads from.

The platforms differ in transport — two are plain public JSON, one is behind a
vendor SDK, one is a stats endpoint that rate-limits aggressively — but they
want the same thing from a cache: keep the last answer, and say when it stopped
being true. So the store is shared and only the *freshness rule* varies.

Most rules are a TTL, chosen from how fast the endpoint actually moves: Sleeper
asks callers to fetch its ~14MB catalog at most once a day, and a finished
season never changes again. Some are not expressible as a duration at all —
basketball's game log is good until the next game tips off, which is a moment
rather than an interval — so a rule is a predicate over when the entry was
stored, and `within` is the common case of one.

A cache is a **directory** and each key is its own file inside it. The
alternative, one document holding every entry, makes storing the smallest value
cost a rewrite of the largest: a trimmed player catalog is megabytes sitting
beside a scoreboard of a few kilobytes, and every write re-encoded the lot.
Per-key files also mean reading one entry never parses the others, and two
writers only collide when they are storing the same key.

Every write goes to a temporary file that is then renamed over the target, so a
process killed mid-write leaves the previous entry intact rather than a
half-written one. Nothing here is precious — the truth lives at the platform,
and a lost or unreadable entry costs one refetch — but a cache that corrupts
itself on Ctrl-C makes the next run slow for no reason.
