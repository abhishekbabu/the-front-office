"""Fantasy Premier League API client.

The official game at fantasy.premierleague.com serves everything read-only over
plain JSON: no key, no OAuth, no per-user token. One endpoint —
`bootstrap-static` — carries the whole player universe, the clubs and all 38
gameweeks in a single ~1MB response, so almost every question is answered from
one cached fetch.

The one endpoint that does need a logged-in session is `my-team/{id}`, which
holds pending state: the bank before this week's transfers, and the free
transfers remaining. It is deliberately not used. Reaching it means scraping a
session cookie out of a browser, which breaks whenever the login flow changes,
and everything it holds can be derived from the public history instead — see
`free_transfers`.
