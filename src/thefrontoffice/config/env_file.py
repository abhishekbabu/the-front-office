"""Reading and writing `.env` in place.

The counterpart to `settings.py`: that module loads configuration, this one
edits the file it loads from, so the UI can set a credential without anyone
opening an editor.

Two rules make the edit safe. Only keys `AppSettings` actually declares are
written, so a typo cannot silently add a line nothing reads — the same failure
`just doctor` exists to catch, and here it is refused outright. And the file is
rewritten line by line rather than regenerated, so comments, ordering and any
key this app does not own all survive.
