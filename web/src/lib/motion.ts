/**
 * The app's motion vocabulary, in one place.
 *
 * Every transition is short and every distance is small: this is a page you
 * check before a deadline, and animation that draws attention to itself is a
 * delay you notice on the second visit. Motion is loaded lazily through
 * `LazyMotion`, which keeps the initial bundle to a few kilobytes rather than
 * the thirty the full library costs.
 *
 * Everything here respects `prefers-reduced-motion` via `MotionConfig` in the
 * app shell, so a viewer who asked for stillness gets it without a branch here.
