 * The way across to the platform this league actually lives on.
 *
 * Reading it is what this app does; the moves are made there, so every view
 * that shows a league offers the way out to it. Always a new tab — you come
 * here to decide and go there to act, and losing the page you decided from is
 * the one thing that must not happen.
 *
 * `noreferrer` alongside `noopener`: the target has no business knowing which
 * page sent you, and `noopener` alone still leaks a referrer.
