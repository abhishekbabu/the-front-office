"""Canned reports, as test data.

Stand-ins for what the model returns, so engine and rendering tests can assert
on a report without one being generated. One per sport, because a basketball
report returned for a football assertion exercises the shape and says nothing
about the sport.

Deliberately not in the package: the application has no use for a fabricated
report, and shipping one invites a code path that returns it.
