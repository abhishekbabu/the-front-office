description: Review this repo's tests for quality and hygiene — trivial tests written to satisfy the coverage floor, assertions on implementation rather than behavior, monkeypatching where a conftest fake exists, tests that reach the network or disk, and vague names. Also applies as guidelines when writing or modifying tests. Invoke with a file or directory path to audit.

# Test Quality Review

Review test files for quality and hygiene. Also serves as guidelines when
writing tests — for engines, providers, platform clients, the FastAPI routes in
`adapters/inbound/web/`, and the front end under `web/src/`.

This repo gates coverage at 95%. That floor is why this skill exists: a hard
percentage rewards tests that execute lines without asserting anything worth
asserting, and those tests cost more than they return — they fail on refactors,
pass on regressions, and make the suite slower to read.

## When this activates

- The user invokes `/review-tests <path>`
- Reviewing tests before a commit, since `just check` runs them anyway
- Auditing an existing test module
- Writing or modifying `tests/test_*.py`, `tests/conftest.py`, or `web/src/**/*.test.ts`

## Input

When invoked with `$ARGUMENTS`:

- A file → review that file.
- A directory → review every `test_*.py` and `*.test.ts` under it.
- Empty → review the test files in the current diff
  (`git diff --name-only HEAD` filtered to test files).

## Rule index

Detailed rules live in `rules/`:

| # | File | Summary |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | `rules/no-framework-testing.md` | Never test pydantic, FastAPI or the standard library — only this app's logic |
| 2 | `rules/behavior-not-implementation.md` | Assert observable outcomes, not which collaborator got called |
| 3 | `rules/invariants-not-snapshots.md` | Test the rule, not a frozen copy of today's output |
| 4 | `rules/descriptive-test-names.md` | The name is the specification |
| 5 | `rules/one-behavior-per-test.md` | Each test has one reason to fail |
| 6 | `rules/fakes-over-monkeypatching.md` | Collaborators arrive by keyword; use the `conftest.py` fakes |
| 7 | `rules/hermetic-by-default.md` | No network, credentials or stray files; `integration` is the opt-out |
| 8 | `rules/coverage-is-not-the-goal.md` | The 95% floor is a floor, not a target to game |
| 9 | `rules/no-caplog.md` | Assert on a named logger through `capture_logs`, never `caplog` |
| 10 | `rules/frontend-pure-functions.md` | Pull logic out of components and test it directly |

## Quick decision checklist

Before writing a test, ask:

| Question | If no |
|----------|-------|
| Does this verify a rule this app decided on? | Don't write it |
| Could it fail from a real behavior change? | If a library guarantees it, skip |
| Would it survive a refactor that kept behavior? | Decouple it from the implementation |
| Is the name a sentence about behavior? | Rename it |
| Does it have exactly one reason to fail? | Split it |
| Does this collaborator already have a fake in `conftest.py`? | Use it instead of monkeypatching |
| Does it stay off the network and out of the real cache? | Fix it, or mark it `integration` |
| Does the module mirror the source module it covers? | Move it |
| Is it asserting on logs? | Use `capture_logs`, naming the logger |

## Review process

### Step 1 — collect
Resolve the input to a list of test files and print it.

### Step 2 — read
For each file: read it in full, then read the source module it covers (follow
the imports). A test can only be judged against what it is supposed to protect.

### Step 3 — classify
For each issue record:

- **file** and **test**: path, and the test function name
- **rule**: which of #1–#10
- **severity**: `high` (the test is worthless or actively harmful), `medium`
  (weak but marginally useful), `low` (naming or style)
- **finding**: one line on what is wrong
- **suggestion**: the concrete fix — "delete this", "assert the returned roster
  instead of the call count", "use `fake_yahoo` rather than monkeypatching"

### Step 4 — report

```
## Test review: <file-or-directory>

### Summary
- Files reviewed: N
- Tests reviewed: N
- Issues: N (high: N, medium: N, low: N)

### Findings

#### <file_path>

| Test | Rule | Severity | Finding | Suggestion |
|------|------|----------|---------|------------|

### Worth keeping
Two or three tests from what you read that show the bar, and why.
```

## Hard rules

- **Read-only.** Do not modify any file. Report, don't fix.
- **Do not suggest new tests.** Coverage gaps are a different job; this skill
  judges the tests that exist.
- **Mocks are not a finding.** A fake standing in for Yahoo or Gemini is the
  intended design here — see rule #6. Flag the *assertion*, not the double.
- **Simple is not a finding.** A one-line rule deserves a one-line test.
  `test_an_empty_name_normalizes_to_empty` is doing its job.
- **Say so when a file is clean.** Do not manufacture findings to fill a table.
- **Cite exactly**: test function name and line number, every time.
