"""Report what this machine is configured for, without printing any secret.

Setting a project up on a second machine means retyping a handful of values,
and the failure mode is silent: `AppSettings` ignores keys it does not
recognize, so `GOOGLE_APIKEY` for `GOOGLE_API_KEY` produces no error at all —
the AI simply reports itself unavailable, three commands later.

This names every setting the app reads, says whether it is present, and flags
anything in .env that no setting will ever pick up.

Run with `just doctor`.
