"""Enforce the agent-guidance conventions.

Mirrors the repo_lint rules that keep this structure honest elsewhere:

  * `AGENTS.md` is the source of truth; the sibling `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to
    it. If it is ever a real file the two drift, and whichever tool reads the
    stale one gets stale rules.
  * Every `AGENTS.md` needs that sibling, or Claude silently sees nothing.
  * `AGENTS.md` stays under 200 lines. Guidance nobody reads is worse than none.
  * Every skill has frontmatter with a name and a description — the description
    is what a model matches against when deciding whether the skill applies.

Run with `just check-agents`.
